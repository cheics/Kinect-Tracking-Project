OVERVIEW  
.............................
This module provides sample code used to demonstrate Kinect NUI processing such as
capturing depth stream, color stream and skeletal tracking frames and displaying them
on the screen.
When sample is executed you should be able to see the following:
- the depth stream, showing background in grayscale and different people in different
  colors, darker colors meaning farther distance from camera. Note that people will
  only be detected if their entire body fits within captured frame.
- Tracked NUI skeletons of people detected within frame. Note that NUI skeletons will
  only appear if the entire body of at least one person fits within captured frame.
- Color video stream
- Frame rate at which capture is being delivered to sample application.
